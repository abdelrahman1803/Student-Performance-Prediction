# Student-Performance-Prediction
Project Overview
The Student Performance Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts a student's academic performance based on both academic and lifestyle factors. The model utilizes features such as study hours, previous scores, sleep hours, and extracurricular activities to forecast the Performance Index, which reflects a student's potential academic success.

Features
Academic Factors: Hours studied, previous academic scores, practice question papers completed.
Lifestyle Factors: Sleep hours, participation in extracurricular activities.
Target: Performance Index (predicted value).
Objectives
Predict student performance using machine learning.
Analyze relationships between academic and lifestyle factors affecting performance.
Provide insights to educators for early intervention and support to at-risk students.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language for data processing and modeling.
Libraries:
Pandas for data manipulation.
NumPy for numerical operations.
Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms and evaluation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-performance-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd student-performance-prediction
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Load the dataset:

The dataset should be in CSV format (e.g., Student_Performance.csv).
Data Preprocessing:

Clean the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
Train the Model:

Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.) using scikit-learn.
Evaluate the Model:

Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² to evaluate model performance.
Visualizations:

Visualize correlations, feature relationships, and performance trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Example
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('Student_Performance.csv')

# Preprocess data (e.g., handle missing values, encode categorical variables)
# ...

# Split data into features and target
X = data.drop(columns='Performance Index')
y = data['Performance Index']

# Split into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
